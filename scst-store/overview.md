# Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu â€“ Store

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store saves software bills of materials (SBoMs) to a database and allows you to query for image, source code, package, and vulnerability relationships.  It integrates with [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/overview.md) to automatically store the resulting source code and image vulnerability reports. It accepts CycloneDX input and outputs in both human-readable and machine-readable formats, including JSON, text, and CycloneDX.


The following is a four-minute demo of scanning an image for CVEs and querying the database for CVEs and dependencies.

## Using the Tanzu Insight CLI plug-in

the Tanzu Insight CLI plug-in is the primary way to view results from the Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan of source code and image files.  Use it to query by source code commit, image digest, and CVE identifier to understand security risks.  

See [Tanzu Insight plug-in overview](../cli-plugins/insight/cli-overview.md) to install, configure, and use `tanzu insight`.

## Multicluster configuration

See [Ingress and multicluster support](ingress-multicluster.md) for information about how to set up Supply Chain Security Tools Scan and Store to work together in a multicluster setup.
