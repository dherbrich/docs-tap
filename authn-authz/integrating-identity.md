# Setting up authentication for Tanzu Application Platform

There are multiple ways to set up authentication for your Tanzu Application Platform deployment. You can choose to manage authentication at the infrastructure level with your kubernetes provider, for example TKG, EKS, AKS or GKE. 

When you have multiple identity management solutions to integrate, for example, if youâ€™re operating Tanzu Application Platform on multi-cloud, VMware recommends installing pinniped.  See our [guide to install pinniped](pinniped-install-guide.md). 

## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid

For TKG clusters, Pinniped is the default identity solution and is installed as a [core package](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-packages-core-index.html). See [TKG documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.4/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-14/GUID-cluster-lifecycle-enable-identity-management.html) for more information about enabling the functionality.
