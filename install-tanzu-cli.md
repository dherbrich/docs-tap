# Installing the Tanzu CLI

## <a id="accept-eulas"></a> Accept the End User License Agreements

Before installing packages, you must accept the End User License Agreements (EULAs).

To accept EULAs:

1. Sign in to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).

2. For each of the following components, accept or confirm that you have accepted the EULA:

    - [Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-cluster-essentials/#/releases/1011100)
    - [Tanzu Application Platform](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform/)
    - [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/build-service/) and its associated components:
        - [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tbs-dependencies/)
        - [Buildpacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-buildpacks-suite)
        - [Stacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-stacks-suite)


This is an example of how to accept EULAs for Tanzu Application Platform:
After signing in to Tanzu Network, select the "Click here to sign the EULA" link in the yellow warning box under the release drop down as seen in the following screen shot. (If this warning is not there then the EULA has already been  accepted).

![EULA Warning](images/install-tanzu-cli-eulas1.png)

Select "Agree" in the bottom right of the dialog box that comes up as seen in the following screen shot.

![EULA Dialog Box](images/install-tanzu-cli-eulas2.png)

This example shows that you have now accepted the EULAs for Tanzu Application Platform. In addition, you must accept the EULAs for Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu and for Tanzu Build Services and its associated components as stated above.

## <a id='install-tanzu-cli'></a> Installing the Tanzu CLI

This document describes how to [Set Kubernetes cluster context](#cluster-context),
[Install Cluster Essentials for Tanzu](#tanzu-cluster-essentials),
and [Install or Update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](#cli-and-plugin) for Tanzu Application Platform:

## <a id='cluster-context'></a> Set Kubernetes cluster context

To set the Kubernetes cluster context:

1. List the existing contexts by running:

    ```
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ kubectl config get-contexts
    CURRENT   NAME                                CLUSTER           AUTHINFO                                NAMESPACE
            aks-repo-trial                      aks-repo-trial    clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-repo-trial
    *       aks-tap-cluster                     aks-tap-cluster   clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-tap-cluster

    ```

2.  Set the context to the cluster that you want to use for the Tanzu Application Platform packages install.
    For example, set the context to the `aks-tap-cluster` context by running:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    Switched to context "aks-tap-cluster".
    ```

## <a id='tanzu-cluster-essentials'></a> Install Cluster Essentials for Tanzu

[Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/index.html)
simplifies the process of installing the open-source [Carvel](https://carvel.dev) tools on your cluster.
It includes a script to download and install supported versions of kapp-controller and
secretgen-controller on the target cluster.
It also installs the kapp, imgpkg, ytt, and kbld CLIs on your local machine.
Currently, Cluster Essentials only supports macOS and Linux.

If you are using a VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster, you don't need to install Cluster Essentials
because the contents of Cluster Essentials are already installed on your cluster.

To install Cluster Essentials, see [Deploying Cluster Essentials](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.1/cluster-essentials/GUID-deploy.html).

    tanzu plugin install --local cli/standalone all
    ```

3. Check the plug-in installation status by running:

    ```
    tanzu plugin list
    ```

    Expect to see the following:

   ```
    tanzu plugin list
    NAME                DESCRIPTION                                                                   SCOPE       DISCOVERY             VERSION      STATUS

    package             Tanzu package management                                                      Standalone  default               v0.11.1      installed

    accelerator         Manage accelerators in a Kubernetes cluster                                   Standalone                        v1.1.0       installed
    apps                Applications on Kubernetes                                                    Standalone                        v0.5.0       installed

   ```

    Ensure that you have the `accelerator`, `apps`, `package`, `secret`, and `services` plug-ins.
    You need these plug-ins to install and interact with the Tanzu Application Platform.

    Tanzu Application Platform requires cluster-admin privileges.
    Running commands associated with the additional plug-ins can have unintended side effects.
    VMware discourages running `cluster`, `kubernetes-release`, `login`, `management-cluster`,
    and `pinniped-auth` commands.

    Currently, `insight` plug-in only supports macOS and Linux.

You can now proceed with installing Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see
**[Installing the Tanzu Application Platform Package and Profiles](install.md)**.


## <a id='update-prev-tap-tanzu-cli'></a> Updating Tanzu CLI Installed for a Previous Tanzu Application Platform Release

Follow these instructions to update the Tanzu CLI that was installed for a previous release of Tanzu Application Platform:

1. Uninstall Tanzu CLI, plug-ins, and associated files by following the steps in
[Remove Tanzu CLI, plug-ins, and associated files](uninstall.md#remove-tanzu-cli).

1. Perform a clean install of the Tanzu CLI by following the steps in [Cleanly Install Tanzu CLI](#tanzu-cli-clean-install) above.
